		<center><p> Due to a continued use of materials such as fossil fuels and coal causing carbon emissions, the future of our planet is uncertain. The gases emitted from the use of fossil fuels have a harmful effect on the Earth's atmosphere, causing more heat to be trapped in our atmosphere. Thus, temperatures rise. Due to warmer temperatures, ice caps in the Arctic have begun to melt. Since ice reverts back water after being melted, sea levels are rising due to climate change. This melting affects arctic wildlife, leaving them stranded in the ocean with little space. This also affects our society, as costal areas such as Florida and Venice will sink underwater due to rising sea levels. We have to act now if things are to change.</p></center>
