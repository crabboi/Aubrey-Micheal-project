		<p id="like"><h5>What Was It Like?</h5>It was slow. Boring. A few moments that were exciting, but nothing too wonderful. I couldn't stop laughing at my favorite podcast, because they were coming up with ideas for Space Jam 2, like have Shaqu have an Infinity Gauntlet, but instead of a gauntlet, it was NBA championship rings.</p>
		<h5> Spaz Jam 2</h5>
		<center><p>Since I mentioned Space Jam 2, I guess I should have my ideas. They could crossover with every single other Warner Brothers Property. Example: Magic Johnson and Harry Potter. See, this movie will be 7 hours long and the R rated Ultimate Jam Edition will be 12 hours long. It would start out with Michael Jordan being Superman against Lebron as Doomsday, and the Krytonite Spear is stolen by the Tiny Toons, so this giant cross over will begin. And the ending will be like Inception. There would be a chase scene with Mad Max. Rocky will be there. There would be a giant mecha basket ball game with Godzilla and the Pacific Rim guys. Yogi Bear is gonna be there. The Terminator will play a Basket Ball game against Robo-Cop. There would be an Oceans 11 heist. Scooby-Doo would finnaly die. Michael Jordan is going to save them from the nuke and say Superman. Shaqu would also reprise his role as Steel. Since Warner is owned by Time Warner, they could have the Aqua Teens and make a joke about Boston bomb scares. Captain Planet is gonna be there. The Mars Attacks aliens will get revenge for the Monstars.
		Space Ghost will go coast to coast. This will be an Oscar pick, it will win every category, cost 1 billion dollars, make 10 billion dollars. This is the greatest movie ever.</p></center>
